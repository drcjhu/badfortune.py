SonarSource/sonar-scanning-examples (github.com)
HINTS: The ‘sonar-project.properties’ file you created in the step above should be in this directory as
well. Make sure SonarQube is running by going into the directory where you installed it then
navigating to [OS]/bin where [OS] is the directory corresponding to your operating system (linux-x86-
64 if you’re using the VM) and running: ./sonar.sh console.
Navigate to the ‘sonar’ directory you created above and initiate a scan: sonar-scanner (if using
the VM). Once the scan is complete, login to the SonarQube console through your browser:
http://localhost:9000. You should now see 1 analyzed project.
